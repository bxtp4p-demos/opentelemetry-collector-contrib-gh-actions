The GitHub Actions Event Receiver processes GitHub Actions webhook events to observe workflows and jobs. It handles `workflow_job` and `workflow_run` event payloads, transforming them into `trace` telemetry.

Each GitHub Action workflow or job, along with its steps, are converted into trace spans, allowing the observation of workflow execution times, success, and failure rates.

If a secret is configured (recommended), it [validates the payload](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/validating-webhook-deliveries) ensuring data integrity before processing.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

* `endpoint` (no default): The endpoint where you may point your webhook to emit events to

The following settings are optional:

* `path` (default: '/events'): Path where the receiver instance will accept events 
* `secret`: Github webhook hash signature

Example:
```yaml
receivers:
    githubactionsevent:
        endpoint: localhost:19418
        path: "/events"
        secret: "sha256=aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899"
```
The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with a detailed sample configuration [here](./testdata/config.yaml)
